<h1 id="Rescheduled-Kentucky-amp-Georgia-Bingo-Halls-Set-to-Reopen-in-October"><a href="#Rescheduled-Kentucky-amp-Georgia-Bingo-Halls-Set-to-Reopen-in-October" class="headerlink" title="Rescheduled: Kentucky &amp; Georgia Bingo Halls Set to Reopen in October"></a>Rescheduled: Kentucky &amp; Georgia Bingo Halls Set to Reopen in October</h1><p>After a hiatus of over two months, Kentucky and Georgia’s bingo halls are all set to reopen in October. Many establishments closed their doors in the wake of sweeping gambling reforms in the two states, which outlawed all electronic forms of the game. But with new regulations now in place that allow for paper-based bingo, hall operators are optimistic about a resurgence in interest come the fall.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, where lawmakers had been looking to close a $200 million budget shortfall, the return of bingo is seen as a much-needed shot in the arm for local economies. The state’s nine bingo halls generated some $11 million in revenue last year, and officials are hopeful that this can be topped with the reintroduction of electronic versions of the game.</p>
<p>For Georgia, the resumption of bingo is also seen as a key means of generating additional revenue. The Peach State had been hemorrhaging cash ever since its own sweeping gambling reforms went into effect at the start of the year. These new regulations saw popular casino games like blackjack and roulette banned, while also outlawing electronic versions of bingo. With paper-based bingo now sanctioned under state law, operators are expecting business to pick up markedly in October.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to tell how things will play out across Kentucky and Georgia come October, there is certainly optimism among both hall operators and state officials alike that reopening will lead to a resurgence in interest for bingo.</p>
<h1 id="Updated-Kentucky-amp-Georgia-Bingo-Halls-Will-Reopen-in-November"><a href="#Updated-Kentucky-amp-Georgia-Bingo-Halls-Will-Reopen-in-November" class="headerlink" title="Updated: Kentucky &amp; Georgia Bingo Halls Will Reopen in November"></a>Updated: Kentucky &amp; Georgia Bingo Halls Will Reopen in November</h1><p>After the closure of all these bingo halls in the state of Kentucky, it has now been announced that they will reopen in November. The bad news is that the moratorium on new licenses will remain in place, so don’t expect any new halls to open any time soon.</p>
<p>The good news is that all of the old bingo halls will be able to reopen andbusiness should return to normal. This is great news for the people of Kentucky, who have been without their favorite pastime for far too long.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the neighboring state of Georgia, things are a little bit different. There are currently no plans to close any bingo halls in Georgia, but the future of the industry there is uncertain.</p>
<p>There have been some recent changes to the laws governing gambling in Georgia, and it’s not clear whether or not these changes will be good for the bingo industry. Some experts believe that this could be the beginning of the end for bingo in Georgia, while others are more optimistic about the future of the industry.</p>
<p>Only time will tell what happens with bingo in Georgia, but at least we know that Kentucky’s bingo halls are coming back soon. So mark your calendars and get ready to head to your local hall for some exciting gaming action!</p>

      Brewers looking to succeed in NL Central

        <h1 id="Brewers-looking-to-succeed-in-NL-Central"><a href="#Brewers-looking-to-succeed-in-NL-Central" class="headerlink" title="Brewers looking to succeed in NL Central"></a>Brewers looking to succeed in NL Central</h1><p>The Brewers are heading into the 2019 season with high expectations after making it to the playoffs last year. They will be looking to compete in a tough NL Central division.</p>
<p>Their key players include Christian Yelich, Lorenzo Cain, and Jesus Aguilar. Yelich was an MVP candidate last year and will likely be one again this year. Cain is a good all-around player and Aguilar had a breakout year last season.</p>
<p>The pitching staff is led by Jhoulys Chacin and Zach Davies. Chacin had a good season last year and Davies is coming back from an injury. Other pitchers include Junior Guerra, Freddy Peralta, and Brandon Woodruff.</p>
<p>The Brewers have made some additions to their team this offseason, most notably Yasmani Grandal who will be their starting catcher. They also acquired Alex Claudio from the Rangers and signed Jeremy Jeffress as a free agent.</p>
<p>The Brewers should be competitive again this year and could make it to the playoffs for the second consecutive year.</p>
<h1 id="Pirates-look-to-compete-and-succeed-in-NL-Central"><a href="#Pirates-look-to-compete-and-succeed-in-NL-Central" class="headerlink" title="Pirates look to compete and succeed in NL Central"></a>Pirates look to compete and succeed in NL Central</h1><p>When the Pirates traded Gerrit Cole in the offseason, they signaled their intentions to compete in 2018. They ended up doing just that, finishing 82-80 and just missing out on the playoffs.</p>
<p>Their success was due in part to a talented young core of players led by outfielder Starling Marte and shortstop Jordy Mercer. Both players are entering their age-29 seasons and should be in their prime.</p>
<p>The Pirates also have some promising young pitchers, including Starter Jameson Taillon and relievers Tyler Glasnow and Felipe Rivero. If those pitchers can take another step forward, the Pirates could make a push for the playoffs in 2019.</p>
<p>One question mark for the Pirates is first baseman Josh Bell. He had a breakout season in 2018, slugging 26 home runs, but it’s unclear if that was a fluke or if he can repeat that level of production.</p>
<p>If Bell can continue to hit for power, the Pirates will be very tough to beat in the NL Central. They’ll have competition from the Brewers and Cardinals, but if everything goes right, they could make it to the postseason for the third time in four years.</p>
<h1 id="Cubs-hope-to-build-off-of-successful-2017-season-and-win-the-NL-Central"><a href="#Cubs-hope-to-build-off-of-successful-2017-season-and-win-the-NL-Central" class="headerlink" title="Cubs hope to build off of successful 2017 season and win the NL Central"></a>Cubs hope to build off of successful 2017 season and win the NL Central</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs had a very successful 2017 season, winning the National League Central Division and making it to the NLCS before losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers. They hope to replicate this success in 2018 and win the NL Central again.</p>
<p>The Cubs have a very talented roster and should be one of the favorites to win the division. Starters Jon Lester, Yu Darvish, Jose Quintana, and Tyler Chatwood are all returning, and they will be joined by offseason acquisition Kyle Hendricks. The bullpen also looks strong, with Wade Davis, Carl Edwards Jr., Pedro Strop, and Brandon Morrow all returning.</p>
<p>The biggest question mark for the Cubs is their offense. They were one of the worst teams in baseball in terms of home runs last season, and they lost some key players this offseason, including Kyle Schwarber, Jason Heyward, and John Lackey. However, they still have plenty of talent offensively, with Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Javier Baez, Ben Zobrist, and Addison Russell all being potential All-Stars.</p>
<p>The Cubs are definitely one of the top teams in the National League this season and should be considered favorites to win the NL Central.</p>
<h1 id="Reds-looking-to-make-some-noise-and-succeed-in-NL-Central"><a href="#Reds-looking-to-make-some-noise-and-succeed-in-NL-Central" class="headerlink" title="Reds looking to make some noise and succeed in NL Central"></a>Reds looking to make some noise and succeed in NL Central</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds are coming into the 2019 season with a lot of hype. They were able to make some big moves in the offseason and have a great young core. Many experts are predicting that they will be able to supplant the Milwaukee Brewers for the NL Central crown.</p>
<p>The Reds were able to sign outfielder Yasiel Puig, as well as pitcher Alex Wood, to long-term contracts this offseason. Puig is coming off of a great year with the Dodgers in which he hit .267&#x2F;.327&#x2F;.486 with 23 homers and 83 RBI. Wood was also very good last season, pitching to a 3.68 ERA in 154 innings pitched.</p>
<p>In addition to their free agent acquisitions, the Reds also boast one of the best farm systems in all of baseball. Their top prospect is outfielder Taylor Trammell, who is ranked as the #13 overall prospect by Baseball America. Trammell hit .293&#x2F;.394&#x2F;.468 with 14 homers and 48 RBI between Single-A and Double-A last season. He is expected to make his major league debut at some point this season.</p>
<p>Other top prospects in the Reds’ system include pitchers Hunter Greene (ranked #4) and Tyler Mahle (ranked #8), as well as infielders Nick Senzel (ranked #5) and Joey Votto (ranked #10). The Reds’ farm system is among the deepest in all of baseball, and that could pay dividends for them this season.</p>
<p>The team has also been bolstered by the return of veteran catcher Devin Mesoraco, who missed most of last season with injuries. Mesoraco hit .309&#x2F;.398&#x2F;.556 with 25 homers and 80 RBI in 2014, so he could provide a big boost to the team’s offense this season.</p>
<p>The Reds will open up their season on March 28th against the Pittsburgh Pirates. They will have their sights set on winning their first division title since 1995.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-eyeing-another-division-title"><a href="#Cardinals-eyeing-another-division-title" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals eyeing another division title"></a>Cardinals eyeing another division title</h1><p>The Cardinals had a great season in 2017, finishing with a record of 93-69 and capturing the National League Central Division title. They are looking to build on that success in 2018 and make a run at the World Series.</p>
<p>One of the keys to their success last year was their strong starting pitching. Led by ace pitcher Carlos Martinez, the Cardinals rotation finished fourth in the National League in ERA last season. They will need another big season from Martinez if they hope to repeat as division champions this year.</p>
<p>Another key for the Cardinals in 2018 will be their offense. They averaged just 4.4 runs per game last season, which was 17th in the National League. They will need to score more runs if they want to compete with the top teams in the league.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are definitely a team to watch out for this season. With a talented roster and a proven track record, they are definitely contenders for the Divisional title and beyond.</p>

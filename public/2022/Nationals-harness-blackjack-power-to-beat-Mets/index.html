        <h1 id="Nationals-harness-blackjack-power-to-beat-Mets"><a href="#Nationals-harness-blackjack-power-to-beat-Mets" class="headerlink" title="Nationals harness blackjack power to beat Mets"></a>Nationals harness blackjack power to beat Mets</h1><p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Behind the strong pitching of Max Scherzer and some timely hitting by the Nationals, Washington downed the Mets 5-2 to take the opening game of their four-game series.</p>
<p>Scherzer (11-5) turned in another dominating performance, striking out 10 while yielding just two runs on six hits over eight innings.</p>
<p>“I had my good fastball going today and that was the key,” Scherzer said. “I was able to mix in my offspeed pitches and keep them off balance.”</p>
<p>Ryan Zimmerman led the Nationals offense with three hits, including a two-run homer in the third inning that gave Washington the lead for good. Daniel Murphy added an RBI double in the sixth inning as Washington improved to an NL-best 50-33 on the season.</p>
<p>“We’ve been playing well all year,” Zimmerman said. “Our pitching has been great and when we score five or more runs we usually win.”</p>
<p>The Mets threatened in the ninth inning but closer Edwin Diaz closed it out for his 24th save of the season.</p>
<p>“Their guy Scherzer was really good tonight,” Mets manager Mickey Callaway said. “You have to give him a lot of credit.”</p>
<p>The Nationals now turn their attention to Game 2 of the series, where they will send Tanner Roark (3-7) to the mound against Mets starter Zack Wheeler (3-6).</p>
<h1 id="Harper-and-Strasburg-lead-Nationals-to-blackjack-victory-over-Braves"><a href="#Harper-and-Strasburg-lead-Nationals-to-blackjack-victory-over-Braves" class="headerlink" title="Harper and Strasburg lead Nationals to blackjack victory over Braves"></a>Harper and Strasburg lead Nationals to blackjack victory over Braves</h1><p>Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper each hit home runs as the Washington Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves 10-6 on Monday night.</p>
<p>Harper hit his 14th homer of the season in the first inning to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. Strasburg followed with a two-run homer in the second inning to make it 4-0.</p>
<p>The Braves cut the lead to 4-3 in the third inning, but Washington answered with five runs in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>Strasburg (8-2) allowed three runs on six hits over six innings. He struck out eight and walked one.</p>
<p>“It was a good outing,” Strasburg said. “I was able to keep them off balance and mix my speeds up.”</p>
<p>Sean Doolittle got the last four outs for his 12th save of the season.</p>
<p>“It’s always nice when you can get some breathing room,” Doolittle said. “They kept battling, so it was nice to close it out.”</p>
<p>Atlanta starter Mike Foltynewicz (1-5) allowed six runs on eight hits over three innings. He struck out four and walked one.</p>
<p>The Nationals have now won six of their last seven games and improved to 38-26 on the season. The Braves have lost four of their last five games and fall to 29-36 on the season.</p>
<h1 id="Scherzer-Rendon-help-Nationals-sweep-Phillies-with-blackjack-win"><a href="#Scherzer-Rendon-help-Nationals-sweep-Phillies-with-blackjack-win" class="headerlink" title="Scherzer, Rendon help Nationals sweep Phillies with blackjack win"></a>Scherzer, Rendon help Nationals sweep Phillies with blackjack win</h1><p>The Washington Nationals were able to sweep the Philadelphia Phillies in a fairly one-sided fashion this past weekend. The Nationals had a combined effort offensively, but it was Max Scherzer and Anthony Rendon who led the way with their blackjack win on Sunday. Scherzer started the game off on the mound and pitched six innings of shutout ball while striking out eight Phillies hitters. Rendon, meanwhile,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> went 4-for-5 at the plate with two homers and six RBIs. This helped the Nationals secure an 8-0 victory and the series sweep.</p>
<p>Washington has now won four consecutive games and is in a good position to make a playoff run later in the season. The Nationals are currently just two games behind the Atlanta Braves for first place in the NL East. They also have a 2 1&#x2F;2 game lead over the Miami Marlins for the second wild card spot in the playoffs. With players like Scherzer and Rendon leading the way, Washington should be able to make some noise in the postseason.</p>
<p>Scherzer has been one of Washington’s most consistent pitchers all season long. He currently has a 12-5 record with a 2.40 ERA and 188 strikeouts. Rendon, meanwhile, is having another great season at the plate. He is batting .301 with 22 homers and 81 RBIs. If both players can continue playing at a high level down the stretch, Washington will be a tough team to beat in October.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-leads-Nationals-to-late-season-surge"><a href="#Blackjack-leads-Nationals-to-late-season-surge" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack leads Nationals to late-season surge"></a>Blackjack leads Nationals to late-season surge</h1><p>In the weeks leading up to the MLB trade deadline, there was much speculation as to whether or not the Washington Nationals would make a move to improve their ballclub. The Nationals were in fourth place in the NL East and limping along, having lost six of their last ten games.</p>
<p>Manager Dave Martinez finally addressed the media on July 25 and announced that the Nationals were not going to make any moves before the deadline. He stated, “Our guys are good players. We believe in them.”</p>
<p>The Nationals then went out and won eight of their next 10 games, including a five-game winning streak to close out July. Their offense came alive in those 10 games, scoring 73 runs - an average of 7.3 runs per game. Much of that offensive firepower was due to rookie outfielder Juan Soto, who hit six home runs in that span.</p>
<p>The hot streak has continued into August, with the Nationals currently boasting an NL-best record of 19-8. They now sit just 2.5 games back of first place in the NL East and appear to be buyers at the upcoming trade deadline.</p>
<p>What changed for the Nationals in those two weeks leading up to the trade deadline? Sure, they got some good performances from their young players like Soto, but what turned things around for them?</p>
<p>Some have suggested that it was Manager Dave Martinez’s decision not to make any trades that gave the team a boost of confidence. In a way, it was as if he was telling his players “I believe in you.” And they responded by playing better baseball.</p>
<p>Others have suggested that it was Bryce Harper’s return from injury that sparked the team’s surge. Harper had been out since May with a knee injury, so his return provided a lift for the team both emotionally and offensively.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, the Nationals are playing much better baseball now than they were earlier in the season and appear poised to make a run at first place in the NL East.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Nationals-use-blackjack-to-win-games"><a href="#How-the-Nationals-use-blackjack-to-win-games" class="headerlink" title="How the Nationals use blackjack to win games"></a>How the Nationals use blackjack to win games</h1><p>The Nationals are a professional baseball team that has been around since 1969. Over the years, they have used blackjack as a tool to help them win games.</p>
<p>One of the most famous cases of this was in the 2014 playoffs against the Giants. In game 1 of that series, the Nationals were down 2-0 in the top of the 8th inning. However, they staged a comeback and eventually won the game 5-2. This was in part due to their use of blackjack during the game.</p>
<p>In particular, they used it to help them predict when the Giants would make their next move. By doing so, they were able to stay one step ahead and gain an advantage over their opponents. This helped them win not just that game, but also game 4 and 5 of the series, which allowed them to advance to the next round.</p>
<p>While blackjack may seem like an unusual tool for a professional sporting team to use, it can be very effective in helping them win games. By predicting what their opponents are going to do, they can stay one step ahead and gain an advantage over them.</p>

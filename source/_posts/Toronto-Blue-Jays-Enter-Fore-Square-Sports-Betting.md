#  Toronto Blue Jays Enter Fore Square Sports Betting

Toronto Blue Jays have been one of the most successful MLB franchises in recent years. The team has made the playoffs four times since 2011 and won back-to-back American League East division titles in 2015 and 2016. [+]

The Blue Jays 2017 season was a disappointment, as the team finished fourth in the AL East with a 76-86 record. However, there is plenty of talent on the roster, and Toronto should be contenders for a playoff spot in 2018.

With spring training underway, let’s take a look at the Blue Jays odds to win the World Series. As of March 5, 2018, Toronto is listed at 18/1 to win the World Series. The Blue Jays are also listed at 8/1 to win the AL Pennant and 2/1 to win the AL East division.

There are several teams that are better bets to win the World Series than Toronto, but there is value betting on the Blue Jays to make it to at least the AL Championship Series. Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka give New York Yankees one of the best rotations in baseball, but I like Toronto’s chances of winning a series against them if they meet in the playoffs.

The Boston Red Sox are also strong contenders in the AL East, but I think Toronto has a good chance of finishing ahead of them. The Blue Jays have Manny Machado eligible to join them after July 31st, and he would make an already powerful lineup even stronger.

If you’re looking for some futures bets on Toronto Blue Jays, I would recommend betting on them to reach either the AL or World Series. The odds may not be great, but there is some value betting on a team that has been as successful as Toronto in recent years.

#  Toronto Blue Jays Expected to be Serious Players in Fore Square Sports Betting

The Toronto Blue Jays have been one of the more successful teams in baseball over the past few seasons. Despite losing in the ALCS last year, they are expected to be serious contenders again this year.

With this success, there has been a lot of discussion about whether or not they will be making a move into sports betting. Recently, there have been reports that the Blue Jays are in talks with Fore Square Sports to become their official gaming partner.

This would make Fore Square Sports the first major North American sports league to partner with a casino company. It would also give the Blue Jays a big advantage in terms of being able to offer their fans legalized sports betting.

While nothing is official yet, it seems likely that this deal will go through. This would be a major win for both parties involved and it could pave the way for other teams to follow suit.

#  Toronto Blue Jays Ready to Soar in Fore Square Sports Betting 

The Toronto Blue Jays are coming off a disastrous 2017 season. They finished last in the AL East with a 76-86 record. Many people are writing them off for this season. I believe that they are primed for a rebound and could make some noise in the Fore Square Sports Betting odds.

 First and foremost, the Blue Jays have an incredibly talented roster. They boast one of the best offenses in all of baseball. Led by Josh Donaldson, Justin Smoak, and Kendrys Morales, this offense can do some serious damage. The pitching staff is also improved from last year. The addition of Jaime Garcia and Brandon Morrow should help tremendously.

Another reason to like the Blue Jays this year is their schedule. Unlike in 2017, they don’t have to face Boston or New York as many times this season. In addition, they play in a weaker division this year. The AL East is much more competitive than it was last year, but the Blue Jays still have a good chance of winning the division.

All in all, there are plenty of reasons to like the Toronto Blue Jays this season. They have an explosive offense, a solid pitching staff, and an easy schedule. I believe that they will be one of the most successful teams in Fore Square Sports Betting this year and will definitely be worth considering when placing your bets.

#  Play the Stoned Joker Game now!

The new Stoned Joker game is a great way to pass the time and have some fun. This free online game is based on the classic card game, War. The goal of the game is to collect as many cards as possible to win.

To play, you'll need two decks of playing cards - one for you, and one for your opponent. Shuffle both decks and deal out all the cards face down. Turn over the top card of each deck - this is your first card. If the numbers on the two cards are different, then you war - place both cards face down in front of you and turn over the next card from each deck. The player who flips over the highest number wins both cards. If the numbers are the same, then both players keep their card.

If the number on your first card is higher than your opponent's first card, then you can take their first card (or all of their cards if it's a higher number). If your opponent doesn't have any cards left, then you automatically win!

The winner is the person with the most cards at the end of the game.

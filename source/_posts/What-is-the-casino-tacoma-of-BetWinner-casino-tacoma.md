What is a Live Casino Bonus?
A Live Casino Bonus is a type of bonus that is offered exclusively to players who choose to play at online casinos that offer live dealer games. These bonuses usually come in the form of free cash or free spins and are designed to give players an incentive to try out these games.

The Different Types of Live Casino Bonuses Available 

There are three main types of live casino bonuses: deposit bonuses, no deposit bonuses, and free spins bonuses.

  Deposit bonuses are the most common type of live casino bonus and require players to make a deposit into their account in order to claim them. These bonuses usually provide players with a 100% match on their deposit amount, meaning that they will double the amount of money that they deposit into their account.   No deposit bonuses are less common than deposit bonuses but can be quite lucrative. These bonuses require no deposit from players and give them a certain amount of free cash (usually between $10 and $50) to use on any live dealer game they choose.   Free spins bonuses are similar to no deposit bonuses in that they provide players with a set number of free spins that can be used on any live dealer game they choose. However, instead of providing players with free cash, these bonuses usually give players a higher value for their free spins compared to other types of bonuses. For example, some casinos might offer 25 free spins with a $5 value per spin, while others might offer 50 free spins with a $1 value per spin. How To Find And Claim A Live Casino Bonus  So now that you know what a live casino bonus is and what different types are available, how do you go about claiming one? The process for claiming most live casino bonuses is fairly simple: -First, visit the website of an online casino that offers live dealer games and open an account there if you don’t already have one. -Then, look for the section of the website that discusses bonus offers and locate the one that corresponds to live dealer games (it will likely be called something like “Live Casino Bonus”). -Finally, clicking on this bonus will take you to information about how to claim it as well as its terms and conditions. Make sure you read over these carefully before deciding whether or not to claim the bonus as they will likely include playthrough requirements (more on this later). The Benefits Of Using A Live Casino Bonus When it comes down to it, there are several reasons why using a live casino bonus is a good idea: -They provide players with extra money to use on their favorite live dealer games -They often come with lower playthrough requirements than other types of casino bonuses -They allow players to try out new games without having to risk any of their own money -They can help players boost their bankrolls quickly and easily FAQs About Live Casino Bonuses Finally, here are some frequently asked questions about live casino bonuses: 1) How long do I have to meet the playthrough requirements before I can withdraw my winnings? This depends on the specific bonus that you claim but typically ranges from 30x-60x the amount of your bonus 2) Can I use my own money along with my bonus funds when playing through the playthrough requirement? No – all funds used during gameplay must come from your bonus 3) What happens if I forfeit my bonus? If you forfeit your bonus (i.e., cancel your membership at the online casino), any funds remaining in your account will be forfeited as well

#  Who is Arsenal FC?

Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in London, England, that plays in the Premier League. The club was formed in 1886 as Woolwich Arsenal and became known as Arsenal in 1893.

Despite being formed long before the Premier League, they only won their first league title in 1991-92. The following season they went on to retain their title and make it a domestic double by also winning the FA Cup. They were the first English side to win a double of this kind and remain the only team ever to have done so.

Arsenal are one of the most successful clubs in English football, having won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and 10 FA Cups. They are also one of only five clubs to have won the Premier League and FA Cup double twice. In addition, they have been runners-up in Europe on three occasions: in 2006–07, 2015–16 and 2016–17.

#  Origins

The club was founded by workers at the Woolwich Arsenal armaments factory in Southeast London in 1886 as "Woolwich Arsenal". From Woolwich they moved to Highbury Stadium in north London in 1913 due to financial pressures caused by problems that arose from their proximity to the Royal Arsenal Ordnance Factory.

The name "Arsenal" was taken from the local area, with "Highbury" coming from the estate on which the stadium was built. Henry Norris, an influential businessman and politician, was instrumental in helping move the club to its new home and changing its name to Arsenal Football Club.

Norris also took over ownership of the club and made it his life's work to promote Arsenal Football Club as much as possible. He helped secure them a place in the newly formed First Division upon its creation in 1888, which would be their home for many years to come.

# Championships and cup successes

Despite being one of England's oldest football clubs, it wasn't until after World War II that Arsenal began enjoying sustained success. This started with winning their first league championship under manager Herbert Chapman in 1931-32. They followed this up by becoming the first team ever to win back-to-back titles in 1933-34 and 1934-35.

#  What do they have in common?

In the business world, there are many different types of companies. But what do they have in common? 

There are a few things that all companies have in common: They need to make money, they need to provide a service or product, and they need to be able to scale. 

Making Money 
All companies need to make money in order to stay afloat. This can be done through selling products or services, but it can also be done through investing money and making a return on investment. There are many different ways to make money, but at the end of the day, all companies need to bring in revenue. 

Providing a Service or Product 
All companies need to provide some type of service or product in order to generate revenue. This could be something as simple as a restaurant providing food, or as complex as an technology company developing new software. No matter what the company does, it needs to be able to offer a product or service that people want or need. 

Scaling 
All companies need to be able to scale in order to grow. This means that the company needs to be able to increase its production in order to meet demand from consumers or businesses. A company that is not able to scale will eventually run into trouble and may not be able to stay in business for very long.

#  Map Shows Which States Have Legalized Gambling

A recent study by Governing Magazine shows which states have legalized some form of gambling. The map above displays that information, with states in green having legalized some form of gambling and states in yellow having only legalized charitable gaming.

As can be seen, the majority of the country has some form of legalized gambling. The exceptions are mostly in the Bible Belt, where conservative values often frown upon gambling. Mississippi is the most gambling-friendly state, with casinos in nearly every county.

It's important to note that just because a state has legalized gambling doesn't mean it's a good idea to gamble there. Some states have very lax regulations and don't require casinos or lotteries to pay out winnings. So always do your research before plunking down your money!

This is a question that is on a lot of people's minds as we get closer to the event. How many fighters will be in the final? We don't have an answer for you, but we can take a look at how many fighters competed in the past few years.

In 2014, there were 858 athletes who competed in the games. In 2015, that number increased to 908. And in 2016, it increased again to 963. So if we were to guess, we would say that there would be close to 1,000 athletes competing in the 2017 games.

But this is only a guess. Ultimately, it is up to the Olympic Committee to decide how many athletes will compete. We will just have to wait and see.

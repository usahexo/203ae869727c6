#  What is the origin of Tutan Keno? 

There is no one definitive answer to this question; different historians offer different explanations. One theory suggests that Tutankhamun, the boy king of Ancient Egypt, invented the game as a way to amuse himself and his courtiers. Another hypothesis proposes that the game originated in China and was brought to Egypt by traders. However, there is no concrete evidence to support either of these theories.

The first recorded mention of Tutankhamun playing keno dates back to the year 1361 BC, but it is likely that the game was invented some time earlier. The aim of the game is to guess which numbered balls will be drawn from a barrel, and players can bet on any number between one and ninety. If they correctly predict the number of balls drawn, they win a prize.

Some people believe that Tutankhamun chose the name ‘keno’ because it sounded similar to the Egyptian word for ‘win’. There are also references to a similar game called ‘pit’ which was played in ancient Rome. In fact, keno is still popular in many parts of the world today; in America, for example, it is known as ‘bingo’.

#  What are the rules of Tutan Keno? 
Players of Tutan Keno can choose any numbers from 1 to 80. After all players have chosen their numbers, the game begins by drawing 20 numbers randomly from a pool of 80 numbers. If a player has chosen one or more of the randomly drawn numbers, they win and are paid according to the payout table.
If no players have matched any of the drawn numbers, then the jackpot prize is increased and another round of play is conducted. This continues until somebody matches at least one number and thereby wins a prize.

The casino's ownership by Mornar has come under criticism by some due to the fact that the company is based in Montenegro. This has led to allegations of money laundering, though no evidence has been found to support these allegations. Some have raised concerns over the fact that Mornar is not a publicly traded company, and thus may not be as accountable to its shareholders as a company that is traded on a stock exchange would be. Additionally, some criticize Mornar for its dealings in other businesses, such as tobacco and oil, which they argue could present conflicts of interest.
